                    )science fiction sitcom created by <a href="mailto:johsan218k@gmail.com">Email</a> 
                Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Cartoon Network's nighttime programming block
                 Adult Swim. The series follows the misadventures of cynical mad scientist Rick Sanchez
                  and his good-hearted, but fretful grandson Morty Smith, who split their time between domestic
                   life and interdimensional adventures.
                Roiland voices the eponymous characters, with Chris Parnell, Spencer Grammer and Sarah Chalke voicing the
                 rest of Rick and Morty's family. The series originated from an animated short parody film of Back to the Future,
                  created by Roiland for Channel 101, a short-film festival co-founded by Harmon. Since its debut, the series
                   has received critical acclaim for its originality, creativity and humor.
                The fifth season premiered on June 20, 2021, and consisted of ten episodes. A sixth season was confirmed as part of a long-term deal in May 2018 that ordered 70 new episodes over an unspecified number of seasons.</p>
